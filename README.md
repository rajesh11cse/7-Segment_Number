2. A Simple Question about NodeJs  
    Q. When is it a good idea to not use NodeJs? Why?
       Node JS is not suitable for high intensive CPU computational tasks as it is single threaded.So it is not good for CPU intensive applications. It is also not suitable for applications which require multi-threaded programmings.
       Use Node.js when you have highly I/O-bound operations that donâ€™t use much CPU.
